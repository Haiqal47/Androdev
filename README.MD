# Androdev [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fahminlb33/Androdev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fahminlb33/Androdev)
Enhaced Android development environment.

## Purpose
> Designed to participate in PSN STEM IPB.

The main purpose of this project is to create a simple installer for Eclipse Mars 2 to work with Android Developer Tools. I've seen many people having trouble to configure Eclipse with ADT for Android development.

Using this installer, people can get a fully working Eclipse IDE with Android Developer Tools (plus Android SDK). This app is divided into two version, *Web installer* and *Standalone installer*. Standalone version of Androdev is not availiable to download, but you must create it yourself (see Wiki).

## Project status
* This project is still **work in process**.
* Use this app at your own risk.
* Nothing has tested.
* No *release candidate* is planned.
